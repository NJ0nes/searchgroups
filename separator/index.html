            <h2>Query</h2>
            <p>This page is a separator to make it clear which tabs came from which
            searches. Often, it is difficult to tell just by looking at the tab names,
            especially because some search engines do not display the query in the page
            title. If you don't want this page to be created, you can uncheck the option
            "create separator tab for searches" at the bottom of the addon preferences
            menu.</p>
