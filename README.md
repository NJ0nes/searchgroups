# Search Groups

Search Groups is a Firefox addon that enables you to search multiple engines at once.
Simply choose which engines you want to group together, give the group a keyword, and
  type `sg ` in the address bar followed by the keyword and a query.

## Features

* Suggestions of group keywords for autocompletion

* Partial matching for group keywords

* Add custom prefix or suffix to query per-engine per-group

* Separator tab to tell which tabs came from which searches (particularly useful with [Tree Style Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/)

* Export and import settings


## Prefixes and Suffixes

Text can be added as a prefix or a suffix to a query for any engine in a group.
For example, if you wanted to search just [/r/firefox](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox)
  on Reddit, you could set the prefix for the Reddit search engine to `subreddit:firefox`.
This will put `subreddit:firefox` before your query when Reddit is searched for
  that group.
The prefix and suffix can be as long as you like (within Firefox's local storage size
  limit of 10 GB), so don't hesitate to use them!
